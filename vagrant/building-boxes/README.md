# Building the Vagrant boxes (superceded by kiwi / OBS build!)

This subdirectory contains resources for building two
[Vagrant](http://vagrantup.com) boxes from the `.vmdk` virtual disks
generated by the [KIWI](https://en.opensuse.org/Portal:KIWI) virtual
appliance image definitions in [`../kiwi`](../kiwi/).

However, since these files were originally built,
[KIWI has learnt how to build Vagrant boxes directly](https://github.com/openSUSE/kiwi/pull/353),
and so has [OBS](http://openbuildservice.org/), so it is not any
longer recommended to build boxes using these files.  They are left
here for posterity.

There are two different boxes defined within this subdirectory:

*   [`cloud-admin`](cloud-admin/) - the SUSE OpenStack Cloud admin node,
    which runs Crowbar and Chef, and
*   [`sles12-sp1`](sles12-sp1/) - a cut-down preload image of SUSE Linux
    Enterprise Server (SLES) 11 SP1, which will be used to provision
    two controller nodes (forming an HA cluster), and a compute node.

Obsolete instructions for building them are contained within the
READMEs in those subdirectories.

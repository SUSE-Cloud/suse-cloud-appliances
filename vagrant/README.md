# Vagrant boxes

This subdirectory contains the resources for building two
[Vagrant](http://vagrantup.com) boxes from the `.vmdk` virtual disks
generated by the [KIWI](https://en.opensuse.org/Portal:KIWI) virtual
appliance image definitions in [`../kiwi`](../kiwi/).

## Building the boxes

There are two different boxes defined within this subdirectory:

*   [`cloud-admin`](cloud-admin/) - the SUSE Cloud admin node,
    which runs Crowbar and Chef, and
*   [`sles11-sp3`](sles11-sp3/) - a cut-down preload image of SUSE Linux
    Enterprise Server (SLES) 11 SP3, which will be used to provision
    two controller nodes (forming an HA cluster), and a compute node.

Instructions for building them are contained within the READMEs in
those subdirectories.

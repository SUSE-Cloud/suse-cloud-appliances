# Vagrant boxes

This subdirectory contains the resources for building two
[Vagrant](http://vagrantup.com) boxes from the `.vmdk` virtual disks
generated by the [KIWI](https://en.opensuse.org/Portal:KIWI) virtual
appliance image definitions in [`../kiwi`](../kiwi/).

## Installing Vagrant

Currently there are two options:

1.  Download and install the [upstream Vagrant rpm for CentOS / Red Hat / Fedora](http://www.vagrantup.com/downloads.html).  It should work fine, although be aware that it
    is a self-contained bundle and so will install an entire version
    of Ruby and all required gems into `/opt/vagrant`.

2.  Install
    [`rubygem-vagrant`](http://software.opensuse.org/package/rubygem-vagrant)
    from the Open Build Service.  This package adheres to openSUSE
    packaging standards, but at the time of writing lags behind the
    upstream release (1.5.4 vs. 1.6.1) and also lacks good plugin
    support for Vagrant Cloud etc.

## Building the boxes

There are two different boxes defined within this subdirectory:

*   [`cloud-admin`](cloud-admin/) - the SUSE Cloud 3 admin node,
    which runs Crowbar and Chef, and
*   [`sles11-sp3`](sles11-sp3/) - a cut-down preload image of SUSE Linux
    Enterprise Server (SLES) 11 SP3, which will be used to provision
    two controller nodes (forming an HA cluster), and a compute node.

Instructions for building them are contained within the READMEs in
those subdirectories.

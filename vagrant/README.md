# Vagrant resources for SUSE OpenStack Cloud

This directory contains:

*   A [`Vagrantfile`](Vagrantfile) and associated files for deploying a
    SUSE OpenStack Cloud environment of (by default) 4 VMs via a single
    `vagrant up` command.  Use this instead of one of the
    [demos](../demos/) if you want more manual control over the setup of
    Crowbar barclamps and OpenStack.  See the
    [HOWTO guide](../docs/HOWTO.md) for more information.
*   A [`box-building/`](box-building/) subdirectory containing a now
    obsolete way of building Vagrant boxes.

SUSE End User License Agreement

PLEASE READ THIS AGREEMENT CAREFULLY.  BY PURCHASING, INSTALLING, DOWNLOADING OR
OTHERWISE USING THE SOFTWARE (INCLUDING ITS COMPONENTS), YOU AGREE TO THE TERMS
OF THIS AGREEMENT.  IF YOU DO NOT AGREE WITH THESE TERMS, YOU ARE NOT PERMITTED
TO DOWNLOAD, INSTALL OR USE THE SOFTWARE AND YOU SHOULD NOTIFY THE PARTY FROM
WHICH YOU PURCHASED THE SOFTWARE TO OBTAIN A REFUND.   AN INDIVIDUAL ACTING ON
BEHALF OF AN ENTITY REPRESENTS THAT HE OR SHE HAS THE AUTHORITY TO ENTER INTO
THIS AGREEMENT ON BEHALF OF THAT ENTITY.

This End User License Agreement ("Agreement") is a legal agreement between You
(an entity or a person) and SUSE LLC ("Licensor").  The software product
identified in the title of this Agreement for which You have acquired licenses,
any media or reproductions (physical or virtual)   and accompanying
documentation (collectively the "Software") is protected by the copyright laws
and treaties of the United States ("U.S.") and other countries and is subject to
the terms of this Agreement.  If the laws of Your principal place of business
require contracts to be in the local language to be enforceable, such local
language version may be obtained from Licensor upon written request and shall be
deemed to govern Your purchase of licenses to the Software.  Any add-on, update,
mobile application, module, adapter or support release to the Software that You
may download or receive that is not accompanied by a license agreement is
Software and governed by this Agreement.  If the Software is an update or
support release, then You must have validly licensed the version and quantity of
the Software being updated or supported in order to install or use the update or
support release. 

LICENSED USE

LICENSES.  The Software and each of its components are owned by Licensor or
other licensors and are protected under copyright laws and other applicable
laws. Subject to compliance with the terms and conditions of this Agreement,
Licensor grants to You a perpetual, non-exclusive, non-transferable, worldwide
license to reproduce and use copies of the Software within Your Organization (as
defined below).  

"Organization" means a legal entity, excluding subsidiaries and affiliates with
a separate existence for tax purposes or for legal personality purposes. An
example of an Organization in the private sector would be a corporation,
partnership, or trust, excluding any subsidiaries or affiliates of the
organization with a separate tax identification number or company registration
number. A public sector example of an Organization would be a specific
government body or local government authority.

THIRD PARTY/OPEN SOURCE.  Nothing in this Agreement shall restrict, limit or
otherwise affect any rights or obligations You may have, or conditions to which
You may be subject, under any applicable open source licenses to any open source
code contained in the Software.  The Software may include or be bundled with
other software programs licensed under different terms and/or licensed by a
third party other than Licensor.  Use of any software programs accompanied by a
separate license agreement is governed by that separate license agreement.  

SUBSCRIPTION SERVICES.  Licensor has no obligation to provide maintenance or
support unless You purchase a subscription offering that expressly includes such

with respect to any trademark, trade name or service mark of Licensor or its
affiliates or licensors ("Mark"). This Agreement does not permit you to
distribute the Software or its components using Licensor's trademarks,
regardless of whether the copy has been modified.  You may make a commercial
redistribution of the Programs only if (a) permitted under a separate written
agreement with Licensor authorizing such commercial redistribution, or (b) you
remove and replace all occurrences of any Mark.  

RESTRICTIONS

License Restrictions.  The Software and each of its components are owned by
Licensor and/or its licensors and are protected under copyright law and under
other laws as applicable. Title to the Software and any component, or to any
copy, modification, or merged portion shall remain with Licensor and other
licensors, subject to the applicable license.  Licensor reserves all rights not
expressly granted to You.  The Software is licensed for Your internal use only.
Except as this Agreement expressly allows and without limiting any rights or
obligations set forth in the "Third Party/Open Source" section above, You may
not (1) remove any patent, trademark, copyright, trade secret or other
proprietary notices or labels on the Software or its documentation; (2) modify,
alter, create derivative works, reverse engineer, decompile, or disassemble the
Software except and only to the extent expressly permitted by applicable law;

sublicense any of Your license grants or rights under this Agreement; in whole
or in part, without prior written permission of Licensor, (4) disclose the
results of any performance, functional or other evaluation or benchmarking of
the Software to any third party without the prior written permission of
Licensor.

party cloud provider or outsourcing vendor  who manages or hosts (either
remotely or virtually) the Software for You, subject to and conditioned upon
Your adherence to the following:  (1) You remain responsible for all of Your
obligations under this Agreement and  enter into an enforceable agreement with
the third party that contains terms and conditions to protect Licensor's rights
in the Software that are no less restrictive than those contained in this
Agreement, including without limitation the Verification section below; (2) You
prohibit use of the Software by the third party for any purpose other than Your
sole benefit; (3) You are solely responsible to Licensor for any and all
breaches of this Agreement by the third party; and (4) You are and will remain
current on subscription purchases that cover all installations and deployments
of the Software by the third party on Your behalf. 

Appliance License.  If, either directly from Licensor or from a third party, you
have received a hardware, software or other appliance that uses the Software,
You acknowledge and agree to use the Software solely for the purpose of running
the appliance and not as a general purpose operating system.  

OWNERSHIP 

No title to or ownership of the Software is transferred to You.  Licensor and/or
its third party licensors retain all right, title and interest in and to all
intellectual property rights in the Software and Services, including any
adaptations or copies thereof.  The Software is not sold to You, You acquire
only a conditional license to use the Software.  Title, ownership rights and
intellectual property rights in and to the content accessed through the Software
are the property of the applicable content owner and may be protected by
applicable copyright or other law.  This Agreement gives You no rights to such
content.

LIMITED WARRANTY

Licensor warrants that the media that the Software is delivered on will be free
from defects in materials and manufacture under normal use for a period of sixty
(60) days from the date of delivery to you.    THE FOREGOING WARRANTY IS YOUR
SOLE AND EXCLUSIVE REMEDY AND IS IN LIEU OF ALL OTHER WARRANTIES, EXPRESS OR
IMPLIED.  SAVE FOR THE FOREGOING WARRANTY, THE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED "AS IS"
WITHOUT ANY WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND.

Services.  Licensor warrants that any Services purchased will be supplied in a
professional manner in accordance with generally accepted industry standards.
This warranty will be effective for thirty (30) days following delivery of the
Services.  Upon any breach of this warranty, Licensor's only obligation is to
either correct the Services so that they comply with this warranty or at its
option refund the amount You paid to Licensor for the portion of the Services
that fail to comply with this warranty.  You agree to take appropriate measures
to isolate and back up Your systems.

THE SOFTWARE IS NOT DESIGNED, MANUFACTURED OR INTENDED FOR USE OR DISTRIBUTION
WITH ON-LINE CONTROL EQUIPMENT IN HAZARDOUS ENVIRONMENTS REQUIRING FAIL-SAFE
PERFORMANCE, SUCH AS IN THE OPERATION OF NUCLEAR FACILITIES, AIRCRAFT
NAVIGATION, COMMUNICATION, OR CONTROL SYSTEMS, DIRECT LIFE SUPPORT MACHINES,
WEAPONS SYSTEMS, OR OTHER USES IN WHICH FAILURE OF THE SOFTWARE COULD LEAD
DIRECTLY TO DEATH, PERSONAL INJURY, OR SEVERE PHYSICAL OR ENVIRONMENTAL DAMAGE.

Non-Licensor Products.  The Software may include or be bundled with hardware or
other software programs or services licensed or sold by an entity other than
Licensor.  LICENSOR DOES NOT WARRANT NON-LICENSOR PRODUCTS OR SERVICES.  ANY
SUCH PRODUCTS OR SERVICES ARE PROVIDED ON AN "AS IS" BASIS.  WARRANTY SERVICE IF
ANY FOR NON-LICENSOR PRODUCTS IS PROVIDED BY THE PRODUCT LICENSOR IN ACCORDANCE
WITH THEIR APPLICABLE WARRANTY.

EXCEPT AS OTHERWISE RESTRICTED BY LAW, LICENSOR DISCLAIMS AND EXCLUDES ANY AND
ALL IMPLIED WARRANTIES INCLUDING ANY WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR
A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, TITLE OR NON-INFRINGEMENT NOR ARE THERE ANY WARRANTIES
CREATED BY COURSE OF DEALING, COURSE OF PERFORMANCE OR TRADE USAGE.  LICENSOR
MAKES NO WARRANTY, REPRESENTATION OR PROMISE NOT EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS
LIMITED WARRANTY.  LICENSOR DOES NOT WARRANT THAT THE SOFTWARE OR SERVICES WILL
SATISFY YOUR REQUIREMENTS, BE COMPATIBLE WITH ALL OPERATING SYSTEMS, OR THAT THE
OPERATION OF THE SOFTWARE OR SERVICES WILL BE UNINTERRUPTED OR ERROR-FREE.  THE
FOREGOING EXCLUSIONS AND DISCLAIMERS ARE AN ESSENTIAL PART OF THIS AGREEMENT AND
FORMED THE BASIS FOR DETERMINING THE PRICE CHARGED FOR THE PRODUCTS.  Some
jurisdictions do not allow certain disclaimers and limitations of warranties, so
portions of the above limitations may not apply to You.  This limited warranty
gives You specific rights and You may also have other rights which vary by state
or jurisdiction.  

LIMITATION OF LIABILITY

Consequential Losses.  NEITHER LICENSOR NOR ANY OF ITS THIRD PARTY LICENSORS,
SUBSIDIARIES, OR EMPLOYEES WILL IN ANY CASE BE LIABLE FOR ANY SPECIAL,
INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, INDIRECT, TORT, ECONOMIC OR PUNITIVE DAMAGES, WHETHER
BASED ON CONTRACT, NEGLIGENCE, STRICTLIABILITY OR OTHER TORT, BREACH OF ANY
STATUTORY DUTY, INDEMNITY OR CONTRIBUTION, INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION LOSS OF
PROFITS, BUSINESS OR DATA, EVEN IF ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF THOSE DAMAGES.
Direct Damages.  IN NO EVENT WILL LICENSOR'S AGGREGATE LIABILITY FOR DIRECT
DAMAGES TO PROPERTY OR PERSON (WHETHER IN ONE INSTANCE OR A SERIES OF INSTANCES)
EXCEED 1.25 TIMES THE AMOUNT PAID BY YOU FOR THE SOFTWARE OR SERVICES OUT OF
WHICH SUCH CLAIM AROSE (OR $50 (U.S.) IF YOU RECEIVED THE SOFTWARE FREE OF
CHARGE).  The above exclusions and limitations will not apply to claims relating
to death or personal injury caused by the negligence of Licensor or its
employees, agents or contractors.  In those jurisdictions that do not allow the
exclusion or limitation of damages, including, without limitation, damages for
breach of any implied terms as to title or quiet enjoyment of any Software
obtained pursuant to this Agreement or for fraudulent misrepresentation,
Licensor's liability shall be limited or excluded to the maximum extent allowed
within those jurisdictions.



GENERAL TERMS

Term.  This Agreement becomes effective on the date You legally acquire the
Software and will automatically terminate if You breach any of its terms.  
Verification. Licensor has the right to verify Your compliance with this
Agreement. You agree to: (1)  Implement internal safeguards to prevent any
unauthorized copying, distribution, installation, use of, or access to, the
Software or Subscription Offerings; (2)  Keep records sufficient to certify Your
compliance with this Agreement, and, upon request of Licensor, provide and
certify metrics and/or reports based upon such records and account for both
numbers of copies (by product and version) and network architectures as they may
reasonably relate to Your licensing and deployment of the Software or
Subscription Offerings; and  (3)  Allow a Licensor representative or an
independent auditor ("Auditor") to inspect and audit Your (including any
subsidiaries or affiliates or contractors with access), computers and records,
during Your normal business hours, for compliance with the licensing terms for
Licensor's software products and/or Subscription Offerings. Upon Licensor's and
Auditor's presentation of their signed written confidentiality statement form to
safeguard Your confidential information, You shall fully cooperate with such
audit and provide any necessary assistance and access to records and computers.
If an audit reveals that You have or at any time have had unlicensed
installation, use of, or access to the Software or Subscription Offerings, You
will, within 30 days, purchase sufficient licenses or Subscription Offerings to
cover any shortfall without benefit of any otherwise applicable discount and
subject to fees reflecting the duration of the shortfall. If a shortfall of 5%
or more is found, You must reimburse Licensor for the costs incurred in the
audit. Transfer.  This Agreement and the associated licenses purchased for use
of the Software may not be transferred or assigned without the prior written
approval of Licensor. Any such attempted transfer or assignment shall be void
and of no effect.  Please contact CRC@suse.com to request the transfer of
licenses and assignment of this Agreement. 
Law. All matters arising out of or relating to this Agreement will be governed
by the substantive laws of the United States and the State of Utah without
regard to its choice of law provisions. Any suit, action or proceeding arising
out of or relating to this Agreement may only be brought before a federal or
state court of appropriate jurisdiction in Utah.  If a party initiates
Agreement-related legal proceedings, the prevailing party will be entitled to
recover reasonable attorneys' fees.  If, however, Your principal place of
business is a member state of the European Union or the European Free Trade
Association, (1) the courts of Ireland shall have exclusive jurisdiction over
any action of law relating to this Agreement; and (2) where the laws of such
country of Your principal place of business are required to be applied to any
such action of law the laws of that country shall apply.  The application of the
United Nations Convention of Contracts for the International Sale of Goods is
expressly excluded.
Entire Agreement.  This Agreement, together with any other purchase documents or
other agreement between You and Licensor, sets forth the entire understanding
and agreement between You and Licensor and may be amended or modified only by a
written agreement agreed to by You and an authorized representative of Licensor.
NO THIRD PARTY LICENSOR, DISTRIBUTOR, DEALER, RETAILER, RESELLER, SALES PERSON,
OR EMPLOYEE IS AUTHORIZED TO MODIFY THIS AGREEMENT OR TO MAKE ANY REPRESENTATION
OR PROMISE THAT IS DIFFERENT FROM, OR IN ADDITION TO, THE TERMS OF THIS
AGREEMENT.  
Waiver.  No waiver of any right under this Agreement will be effective unless in
writing, signed by a duly authorized representative of the party to be bound.
No waiver of any past or present right arising from any breach or failure to
perform will be deemed to be a waiver of any future right arising under this
Agreement.
Severability.  If any provision in this Agreement is invalid or unenforceable,
that provision will be construed, limited, modified or, if necessary, severed,
to the extent necessary, to eliminate its invalidity or unenforceability, and
the other provisions of this Agreement will remain unaffected.  
Export Compliance.  You acknowledge that Licensor's products and/or technology
are subject to the U.S. Export Administration Regulations (the "EAR") and You
agree to comply with the EAR.  You will not export or re-export Licensor's
products, directly or indirectly, to: (1) any countries that are subject to US
export restrictions; (2) any end user who You know or have reason to know will
utilize Licensor's products in the design, development or production of nuclear,
chemical or biological weapons, or rocket systems, space launch vehicles, and
sounding rockets, or unmanned air vehicle systems, except as authorized by the
relevant government agency by regulation or specific license; or (3) any end
user who has been prohibited from participating in the US export transactions by
any federal agency of the US government. By downloading or using the Software,
You are agreeing to the foregoing and You are representing and warranting that
You are not located in, under the control of, or a national or resident of any
such country or on any such list. In addition, You are responsible for complying
with any local laws in Your jurisdiction which may impact Your right to import,
export or use Licensor's products.  Please consult the Bureau of Industry and
Security web page www.bis.doc.gov before exporting items subject to the EAR. For

Classification Number (ECCN) and associated license exception (as applicable),
see www.suse.com/company/legal/. Upon request, Licensor's International Trade
Services Department can provide information regarding applicable export
restrictions for Licensor products. Licensor assumes no responsibility for Your
failure to obtain any necessary export approvals.

# Input file for 'crowbar batch build' command which sets up a cloud
# with a single 2-node HA cluster using NFS and manually configured
# STONITH (can be SBD, for instance), and a single KVM compute node.
#
# If nodes are libvirt VMs, it is possible to configure STONITH with
# libvirt (hence no need for manual configuration): it's simply a matter
# of uncommenting a few lines in the pacemaker proposal below.
#
# The 192.168.124.10 IP address must be replaced with the IP address of
# the admin server in case it got changed.

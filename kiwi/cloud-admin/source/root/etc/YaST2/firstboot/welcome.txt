<p><b>Welcome!</b></p>
<p>
 There are a few more steps to take before the SUSE OpenStack Cloud Admin
 Server is ready to use.
</p>
<p>
 Please agree to the End User License Agreements, and then define the initial
 settings to use for the deployment. This guide will then end, and you will be
 able to complete the setup by connecting to the web interface of the SUSE
 OpenStack Cloud Admin Server.
</p>
<p>
 As part of the initial settings, it is important that the network
 configuration that you defined is correct: if not, you will need to start
 over.
 Please refer to the SUSE OpenStack Cloud Deployment Guide for more
 information.
 In case of doubt, you may execute again <tt>yast2 crowbar</tt> after this
 guide to double-check or change again the settings before proceeding further.

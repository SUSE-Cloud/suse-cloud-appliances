 <b>The first part of the setup of the SUSE OpenStack Cloud Admin Server has
 completed successfully!</b>
</p>
<p>
 Complete the setup of the SUSE OpenStack Cloud Admin Server by connecting to
 the web interface at <b>http://192.168.124.10/</b> (or the IP address you
 picked for the Admin Server in the admin network during the initial settings).
</p>
<p>
 If you changed the IP range of the admin network, then you will need to update
 the IP address of the Admin Server accordingly in <tt>/etc/hosts</tt> and
 <tt>/etc/sysconfig/network/ifcfg-eth0</tt> as well as the default route in
 <tt>/etc/sysconfig/network/routes</tt> and the DNS server in
 <tt>/etc/resolv.conf</tt>. Reconfiguring the network interface will also be
 required; this can be achieved with <tt>ifdown eth0 && ifup eth0</tt>.

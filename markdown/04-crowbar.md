### What were the
# Design Goals
### for adding HA to Crowbar?
Note:
- guest HA out of scope
- infrastructure tolerant to admin node failure


### Build from scratch
# and
### upgrading an existing cloud
Note: support existing customers


### Flexible allocation of
# roles
### across potentially multiple clusters
Note:
- not too opinionated about sizing
- allow growing the cluster later


# Automated
### configuration
Note: reduce complexity and learning curve

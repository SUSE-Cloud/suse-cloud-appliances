# Pre-canned demos of SUSE OpenStack Cloud functionality

This subdirectory contains resources for automatically
preparing and presenting demos of SUSE OpenStack Cloud functionality
from within a Vagrant environment.

## Demos

Currently there are two demos available:

*   [Automatically deploying a Wordpress stack on OpenStack](heat-wordpress/) using
    [OpenStack Orchestration (a.k.a. Heat)](https://wiki.openstack.org/wiki/Heat)
*   [Automatically deploying highly available OpenStack services](HA/) using
    the Pacemaker barclamp

You are warmly encouraged to
[send pull requests](https://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests/)
adding more demos!  You can use the existing ones as examples of how
to build new ones.

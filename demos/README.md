# Pre-canned demos of SUSE Cloud functionality

This subdirectory contains resources for automatically
preparing and presenting demos of SUSE Cloud functionality from
within a Vagrant environment.

## Demos

Currently there is only one demo available:

*   [Automatically deploying a Wordpress stack on OpenStack](heat-wordpress/) using
    [OpenStack Orchestration (a.k.a. Heat)](https://wiki.openstack.org/wiki/Heat)

You are warmly encouraged to
[send pull requests](https://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests/)
adding more demos!  You can use the existing one as an example of how
to do it.
